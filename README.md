## **Description**

This application serves as a portfolio to share my projects and work with other developers and when applying for jobs. This is the front-end component of my portfolio that I created using React. I also used the Bootstrap framework to help with styling. The application will work and update on a single page without the need to refresh the entire page. The navbar will highlight the section that is clicked and the page will update to render that specific section. There will be an About Me section that gives a short description of myself and the technologies I have learned throughout this course. The contact card will alert the user if their email address is invalid or if they have not input data into every field of the form. Navigating to the Resume tab will display a list of my technology proficiencies and a link to download my resume. Finally, the Portfolio tab of this page will showcase my previous applications I have worked on with an image of the application and links to the deployed app and the Github repository. 

## **Usage**
Please visit https://emmasiren.github.io/react-portfolio to view the deployed application. Below you will find an image of the application.
